#print("Hello World")
print("Lucky", "Denise", "Tony", sep="*", end="\n")
print("Lucky")

#print (self, *args, sep=' ', end='\n'. file =None)
#self - ignore this for now, we will cover it in OOPs
# *args - multiple number of arguments you can enter
# sep - separator = space
# end = how you want to print the after end.
#file - files we will cover that soon
